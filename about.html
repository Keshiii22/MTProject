            </h1>
            <p>
                I am John Kenneth C. Castillo, 19 years old and I live in 13 Baay, City of Batac, Ilocos Norte. I am a simple person who enjoys learning new things and exploring different interests. One of my favorite sports is volleyball because it helps me stay active, build confidence, and connect with other people through teamwork. During my free time, I also enjoy playing Mobile Legends. It may just be a game, but for me it is a way to relax, sharpen my strategy, and spend enjoyable moments with friends. Aside from sports and games, I have a big interest in academics, especially in solving logical math equations. I like the challenge of working with numbers and finding the right answers because it makes me feel accomplished.

            <p>
                I also have a strong passion for creativity. I love making graphic art where I can express my ideas and imagination. This passion inspires me to dream of becoming a professional graphic artist as well as a web developer in the future. I believe that combining creativity with technology will allow me to do work that I truly enjoy while also being useful to others. My biggest goal is to finish my studies, improve my skills, and build a successful career that will help me support myself and my loved ones. More than just earning money, I want to create a future where I can be proud of my hard work, my achievements, and the person I will become.
