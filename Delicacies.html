                Batac pakbet is a variation of the traditional Filipino dish pinakbet, from the Ilocos region, that features a medley of local vegetables stewed in a savory shrimp paste (bagoong alamang) or fish paste (bagoong isda) sauce. The dish's name comes from the Ilocano word "pinakebbet," meaning "shriveled," which refers to the cooked vegetables. Batac pinakbet often includes ingredients like bitter melon (ampalaya), eggplant, okra, and string beans, and is typically enhanced with pork belly (bagnet) for added flavor.
